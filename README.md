# IRI 2023 picker

An experiment with using ML to generate a picklist for IRI 2023.

The idea was to look for trends in performance at IRI compared with overall performance in season.

In practice, the output of the model was to just sort the teams by EPA.
This is likely because EPA is too noisy of a metric to make meaningful predictions with.
